It is a REST API that I have created while doing my internship from Rely Healthcare Technologies located in Guwahati, Assam. This REST API will display the current records
as well as the future predictions of the requirements of the medical equipment by several medical organizations spread across the entire North-East India.
The future predictions can be obtained using the concept of Time Series Forecasting that involves python programming. The Time Series Forecasting is a machine learning model
that is used for predicting future trends and values in time-series data.
